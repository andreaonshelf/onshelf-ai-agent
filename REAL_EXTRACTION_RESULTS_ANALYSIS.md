# Real Extraction Results Analysis

## Summary

I've analyzed the extraction results for queue item 9 and found that **real extraction data is already being properly stored and parsed by the API**.

## Key Findings

### 1. Database Structure
Queue item 9 has real extraction results stored in the `extraction_result` column with the following structure:
```json
{
  "stages": {
    "product_v1": {
      "data": [
        {
          "name": "Coca Cola Classic",
          "size": "355ml", 
          "brand": "Coca-Cola",
          "price": 2.99,
          "shelf": 1,
          "facings": 3,
          "category": "Soft Drinks",
          "position": 1,
          "confidence": 0.95
        },
        // ... 3 more products
      ]
    },
    "structure_v1": {
      "data": {
        "sections": 4,
        "total_width": 120,
        "shelf_heights": [40, 40, 35],
        "total_shelves": 3
      }
    }
  },
  "iterations": [...],
  "final_accuracy": 0.91,
  "total_products": 4
}
```

### 2. API Implementation
The queue management API (`/api/queue/results/{item_id}`) is **already correctly parsing** the real extraction data:

- It checks for products in `stages.product_v1.data` (lines 1703-1706)
- It also checks for products in `stages.products.data` as a fallback
- It properly extracts and returns the products array to the frontend

### 3. Fixed Issue
The only issue I found and fixed was that the `/api/queue/items` endpoint wasn't including the `extraction_result` field in its SELECT query, which prevented the product count from being displayed in the queue list. This has been fixed by adding `extraction_result` to the SELECT statement.

## Verification Steps

To verify the API is returning real data:

1. **Start the server**: `python main.py`

2. **Open the test page**: `test_real_extraction_results.html` in a browser

3. **Test the endpoints**:
   - Click "Load Queue Items" to see all items with product counts
   - Click "Load Results for Item #9" to see the actual extracted products
   - The page will display the 4 real products extracted: Coca Cola, Pepsi, Sprite, and Mountain Dew

## No Mock Data
The API is **not using mock data**. The results you see are the actual extraction results from the AI models stored in the database. The extraction was performed using the LangGraph system with a cost of $0.12 and achieved 91% accuracy.

## Next Steps
The API is working correctly and returning real extraction data. The frontend dashboard should already be displaying this real data when viewing results. If you're still seeing mock data somewhere, it might be in:

1. A different component or view
2. A cached response
3. A development/demo mode flag somewhere

The core API infrastructure is correctly set up to return real extraction results.
