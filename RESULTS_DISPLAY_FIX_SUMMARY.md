# Results Display Fix Summary

## Problem
Clicking on extractions in the sidebar wasn't showing results. The Results page was expecting data in a specific format but the API was returning raw database fields.

## Root Cause
1. The frontend expected a `products` array directly on the results object
2. The API was returning raw `extraction_result` and `planogram_result` JSON fields
3. The sidebar expected `extraction_results.total_products` for the product count display
4. No parsing was being done to extract the actual product data from the nested extraction results

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed `/api/queue/results/{item_id}` endpoint
- Added parsing logic to extract products from various possible locations in extraction_result:
  - `extraction_result.stages.products.data`
  - `extraction_result.stages.product_v1.data`
  - `extraction_result.products` (root level)
- Added parsing for planogram SVG from planogram_result
- Added image URL construction using the queue image endpoint
- Formatted the response to match frontend expectations with fields like:
  - `products`: Array of product objects
  - `total_products`: Count of products
  - `planogram_svg`: Extracted SVG string
  - `original_image_url`: Image URL for display
  - `completed_time`: Formatted completion timestamp

### 2. Fixed `/api/queue/items` endpoint
- Added extraction result parsing to include `extraction_results.total_products` for sidebar display
- This allows the sidebar to show product counts for completed extractions

### 3. Test Data
- Created test extraction data with 4 products for item 9
- Data includes all expected fields: name, brand, price, shelf, position, facings, confidence

## File Changes
- `/src/api/queue_management.py`: 
  - Modified `get_queue_item_results()` to parse and structure data correctly
  - Modified `get_queue_items()` to include extraction results summary

## Testing
1. Added test extraction data to queue item 9 with 4 products
2. The Results page should now properly display:
   - Product list in a table
   - Store and category information
   - Processing statistics
   - Planogram visualization (when available)
   - Original image

## Usage
1. Navigate to the Results tab in the dashboard
2. Click on any completed extraction in the sidebar
3. The main content area will show:
   - Extraction details
   - Product table with all extracted items
   - Options to correct data or add missing products
   - Iterations and performance data
