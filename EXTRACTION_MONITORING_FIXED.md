# Extraction and Monitoring System - Fixed

## What Was Fixed

### 1. JavaScript Errors in Dashboard
- Fixed "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'map')" errors by adding null checks
- Fixed ReactDOM.render deprecation warning (though not critical)

### 2. Image Path Retrieval  
- Fixed system_dispatcher.py to properly retrieve image paths from media_files table
- No database modifications required - the code now checks both queue items and media_files

### 3. Manual/Automatic Processing Mode
- Added a switch in the dashboard to toggle between manual and automatic processing
- In manual mode, items are only processed when you click "Process"
- In automatic mode, the queue processor will handle items automatically

### 4. Removed ALL Fake Data
- Disabled mock data initialization in main.py
- Created scripts to clean up fake completed items (91% accuracy with no real data)
- No more fake data masking real problems

### 5. Fixed Extraction Monitoring
- Fixed monitoring hooks to properly register and update
- Fixed syntax errors in custom_consensus_visual.py
- Fixed missing response_model parameter in extraction_engine.py
- Monitoring now shows real-time updates during extraction

## Current Status

The extraction system is now functional and will:
1. Actually process items when you click "Process"
2. Show real-time monitoring data including:
   - Current iteration (1/5, 2/5, etc.)
   - Current stage (structure, products, details)
   - Current model being used (GPT-4o, Claude, Gemini)
   - Processing status updates

## Known Issues

1. **Validation Errors**: The models may return data that doesn't match the expected schema (like missing shelf_coordinates). This is normal and the system will retry with different prompts.

2. **WebSocket Errors**: You may still see WebSocket connection errors in the console. These don't affect functionality.

## How to Use

1. **Start the server**: 
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Open the dashboard**: 
   http://localhost:8130/new_dashboard.html

3. **Process items**:
   - Make sure "Manual" mode is selected in the Queue tab
   - Click "Process" on any item
   - Click "Monitor" to see real-time extraction progress
   - The monitoring modal will show:
     - Current iteration and stage
     - Which AI model is currently processing
     - Duration and progress updates

4. **Reset stuck items** (if needed):
   ```bash
   python reset_stuck_items.py
   ```

## Testing

To test extraction directly with monitoring:
```bash
python test_real_extraction.py
```

This will:
- Pick an item from the queue
- Reset it to pending status
- Start extraction with full monitoring
- Show real-time progress in the console

## What You'll See

When extraction is working properly, the monitoring modal will show:
- "Processing structure with model 1/3: gpt-4o" 
- "Iteration 1/5 - Processing products"
- Model status updates (Waiting, Processing, Complete)
- Actual progress instead of "Loading monitoring data..."

The extraction will make real API calls to AI models and process the images.
