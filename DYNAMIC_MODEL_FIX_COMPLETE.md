# Dynamic Model Loading Fix - COMPLETE

## Problem Found
ALL extraction stages (structure, products, details) were using hardcoded schemas instead of the user-configured field definitions. This is why your configured prompts and fields weren't being used.

## Root Cause
The extraction orchestrator was passing hardcoded schema strings to the extraction engine:
- Structure stage: `"ShelfStructure"`
- Products stage: `"List[ProductExtraction]"` 
- Details stage: `"List[ProductExtraction]"`

These hardcoded strings meant the system completely ignored your field configurations stored in `stage_fields`.

## Fix Applied
I've updated all three extraction stages to:

1. **Check for configured fields**: Each stage now checks if `stage_fields[stage_name]` exists
2. **Build dynamic models**: If fields are configured, it uses `DynamicModelBuilder.build_model_from_config()` to create a Pydantic model from your field definitions
3. **Use the dynamic model**: The dynamic model is passed to the extraction engine instead of the hardcoded string

### Code Changes Made:

#### Structure Stage (line 929-941)
```python
# Determine output schema - use dynamic model if configured
output_schema = "ShelfStructure"  # Default

if hasattr(self, 'stage_fields') and 'structure' in self.stage_fields:
    fields = self.stage_fields['structure']
    if fields:
        logger.info(f"Building dynamic model for structure stage with {len(fields)} fields")
        # Build dynamic model from configured fields
        output_schema = DynamicModelBuilder.build_model_from_config(fields, 'StructureV1')
```

#### Products Stage (line 604-619 and similar blocks)
```python
# Determine output schema - use dynamic model if configured
output_schema = "List[ProductExtraction]"  # Default

if hasattr(self, 'stage_fields') and 'products' in self.stage_fields:
    fields = self.stage_fields['products']
    if fields:
        logger.info(f"Building dynamic model for products stage with {len(fields)} fields")
        # Build dynamic model from configured fields
        from typing import List
        ProductModel = DynamicModelBuilder.build_model_from_config(fields, 'ProductV1')
        output_schema = List[ProductModel]
```

#### Details Stage (line 1110-1124)
```python
# Determine output schema - use dynamic model if configured
output_schema = "List[ProductExtraction]"  # Default

if hasattr(self, 'stage_fields') and 'details' in self.stage_fields:
    fields = self.stage_fields['details']
    if fields:
        logger.info(f"Building dynamic model for details stage with {len(fields)} fields")
        # Build dynamic model from configured fields
        from typing import List
        DetailModel = DynamicModelBuilder.build_model_from_config(fields, 'DetailV1')
        output_schema = List[DetailModel]
```

## What This Means
Now when you configure fields in the UI:
1. Your prompts ARE loaded (this was already working)
2. Your field definitions ARE used to build dynamic extraction models (THIS WAS THE MISSING PIECE)
3. The AI will extract exactly the fields you've configured, not the hardcoded defaults

## Next Steps
1. Test an extraction to verify the dynamic models are being used
2. Check the logs for messages like "Building dynamic model for [stage] stage with X fields"
3. Verify that extracted data matches your configured field schemas

The system should now properly use ALL your configurations - both prompts AND field definitions!
