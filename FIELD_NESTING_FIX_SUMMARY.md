# Field Nesting Fix Summary

## Problem
Users were defining fields in a logical hierarchy in the UI:
```
- structure_extraction (Object - nested)
  - shelf_structure (Object - nested)
    - total_shelves (Integer)
    - shelf_type (String)
    - fixture_width (Number)
    - fixture_height (Number)
```

But the system was generating a Pydantic model that expected `structure_extraction.structure_extraction`, which was incorrect and caused validation errors.

## Solution
Created a comprehensive fix that automatically detects and flattens nested field definitions to match what Pydantic expects.

### Key Components

1. **`fix_field_definition_nesting.py`**
   - Contains the core fix functions:
     - `flatten_nested_field_definitions()` - Recursively flattens nested object structures
     - `build_extraction_model_safe()` - Builds Pydantic models with automatic flattening
   - Handles various field definition patterns

2. **`apply_field_nesting_fix.py`**
   - Script to apply the fix to the running system
   - Patches the existing dynamic model builder
   - Includes tests to verify the fix works

3. **Updated `field_definitions.py`**
   - Added new endpoint: `POST /field-definitions/stage/{stage_name}`
   - Integrates the fix when building stage-specific field schemas
   - Returns properly flattened Pydantic schemas

## How It Works

1. **Detection**: The fix detects when field definitions have unnecessary nesting
2. **Flattening**: Recursively flattens nested object properties to the root level
3. **Model Building**: Creates Pydantic models with the flattened structure

### Example Transformation

User defines:
```json
{
  "structure_extraction": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "shelf_structure": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "total_shelves": {"type": "integer"},
          "shelf_type": {"type": "string"}
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

System generates model expecting:
```json
{
  "total_shelves": 5,
  "shelf_type": "gondola"
}
```

## Benefits

1. **No UI Changes Required**: Users can continue defining logical hierarchies
2. **Automatic Adaptation**: The system adapts to user-defined structures
3. **Backward Compatible**: Existing flat structures continue to work
4. **Comprehensive**: Handles various nesting patterns

## Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
python test_field_nesting_fix.py
```

Apply the fix:
```bash
python apply_field_nesting_fix.py
```

Test the endpoint:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8130/field-definitions/stage/structure -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{}'
```

## Integration Points

The fix is integrated at these key points:
1. Dynamic model builder (`src/extraction/dynamic_model_builder.py`)
2. Field definitions API endpoint
3. Any future code that builds Pydantic models from field definitions

## Next Steps

1. Monitor for any edge cases in field definition patterns
2. Consider adding UI hints to show how fields will be flattened
3. Update documentation to explain the field definition structure
