# Extraction Systems Fix Summary

## Current Status

### 1. Custom Consensus Visual System ‚úÖ
- **Status**: FULLY WORKING with real extraction
- Uses `ModularExtractionEngine` for actual AI calls
- Implements visual feedback loop
- Uses dynamic models from user configuration
- Processes real images

### 2. LangGraph System üîß PARTIALLY FIXED
- **Status**: Structure extraction now uses real AI, but other stages still mock
- **What I Fixed**:
  - Added extraction engine import and initialization
  - Replaced `_run_structure_agents` with real extraction
  - Added helper methods for parsing results
  - Started fixing position extraction
- **Still Needs**:
  - Complete the position, quantity, and detail nodes to use real extraction
  - Remove all mock data generation

### 3. Hybrid System ‚ùå NOT YET FIXED
- **Status**: Still using mock data
- **What I Did**:
  - Added extraction engine import and initialization
- **Still Needs**:
  - Replace all mock consensus methods with real extraction
  - Implement proper LangChain + real extraction integration

## Why Extractions Were Going Straight to "Completed (Review)"

The systems were returning mock/fake data instead of actually processing images:
- LangGraph: Returns "LangGraph Product 1", "LangGraph Product 2", etc.
- Hybrid: Returns mock prices of $2.99, facing counts of 2, etc.
- Only Custom Consensus Visual was doing real extraction

## What Needs to Be Done

### For LangGraph System:
1. Complete the real extraction implementation for:
   - `_quantity_consensus_node`
   - `_detail_consensus_node`
2. Ensure all nodes use `self.extraction_engine.execute_with_model_id()`
3. Remove all hardcoded/mock data

### For Hybrid System:
1. Replace mock methods in `HybridConsensusEngine`:
   - `_analyze_with_custom_logic`
   - `_analyze_with_langchain`
   - Position/quantity/detail extraction methods
2. Use real extraction engine calls
3. Integrate LangChain memory with real extraction results

### Key Pattern for Real Extraction:
```python
# Get configuration
prompt = self.stage_prompts.get(stage, default_prompt)
output_schema = self._get_output_schema_for_stage(stage)

# Real extraction
result, cost = await self.extraction_engine.execute_with_model_id(
    model_id=model,
    prompt=prompt,
    images={'enhanced': image_data},
    output_schema=output_schema,
    agent_id=f"{system}_{stage}_{model}"
)
```

## Testing
Once fixed, all three systems should:
1. Actually call AI models (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini)
2. Process real images
3. Use user-configured prompts and fields
4. Take 30-60 seconds to process (not instant)
5. Show real product names from the images
6. Have actual API costs
