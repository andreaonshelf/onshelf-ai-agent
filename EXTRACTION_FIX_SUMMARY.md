# Extraction Fix Summary

## The Problem
1. Your carefully defined field structures in the database were being IGNORED
2. The system was using hardcoded Pydantic models (ShelfStructure, ProductExtraction) instead of your fields
3. AI was returning data matching YOUR fields, but code expected DIFFERENT fields
4. This caused validation errors like "shelf_coordinates Field required"

## What We Fixed

### 1. Created Dynamic Model Builder
- **File**: `src/extraction/dynamic_model_builder.py`
- Converts your field definitions to Pydantic models at runtime
- Handles nested objects, lists, enums, and all field types you defined

### 2. Updated Custom Consensus Visual System
- **File**: `src/systems/custom_consensus_visual.py`
- Now builds dynamic models from your field definitions
- No longer uses hardcoded "ShelfStructure" schema

### 3. Updated System Dispatcher
- **File**: `src/orchestrator/system_dispatcher.py`
- Passes full stage configurations (including fields) to extraction system
- Not just prompts, but complete field definitions

### 4. Updated Extraction Engine
- **File**: `src/extraction/engine.py`
- Detects when output_schema is a Pydantic model class
- Uses your dynamic models as response_model for AI calls

### 5. Cleaned Up Fake Data
- Removed fake 91% accuracy from database
- Disabled mock data initialization endpoint

## How It Works Now

1. **Configuration Loading**:
   - Your Version 1 config has fields like `structure_extraction` with `total_shelves`
   - These are loaded from the database with full type information

2. **Dynamic Model Building**:
   ```python
   # Your field definition:
   {
     "name": "structure_extraction",
     "type": "object",
     "nested_fields": [
       {"name": "total_shelves", "type": "integer", ...}
     ]
   }
   
   # Becomes Pydantic model:
   class StructureExtractionModel(BaseModel):
       structure_extraction: StructureExtraction
   ```

3. **AI Extraction**:
   - Your prompt is sent to AI
   - AI response is validated against YOUR model
   - Data matches YOUR field structure

## Next Steps

To process an item:
1. Click "Process" on a queue item
2. The system will:
   - Load your saved configuration (Version 1)
   - Build dynamic models from your field definitions
   - Send your prompts to AI
   - Expect responses matching YOUR field structure
   - Save real extraction results

No more hardcoded schemas. No more field mismatches. Your field definitions drive the entire extraction process.
