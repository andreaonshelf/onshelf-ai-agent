# Planogram Implementation Status

## Current State

The exact planogram rendering rules from EXACT_WORKING_DEMO.html have been identified and are already implemented in main.py:

### 1. createSimpleGridPlanogram Function (line 9389)
- ✅ Already contains the exact cumulative positioning algorithm
- ✅ Implements global width consistency (all shelves same width)
- ✅ Uses gravity-based stacking (products align to shelf bottom)
- ✅ Proper facing distribution (each facing gets own cell)
- ✅ Hidden section system (Left/Center/Right for AI)
- ✅ Grid-based 2D visualization
- ✅ Empty slots are transparent
- ✅ Stack visualization (vertical arrangement for depth)

### 2. getConfidenceColor Function (line 9478)
- ✅ Already implements exact color mapping:
  - Green (#22c55e): ≥95% confidence
  - Blue (#3b82f6): 85-94% confidence
  - Orange (#f59e0b): 70-84% confidence
  - Red (#ef4444): <70% confidence

### 3. Usage in Dashboard
- ✅ Simple Mode (line 5435): Uses createSimpleGridPlanogram correctly
- ✅ Advanced Mode: Uses InteractivePlanogram React component
- ⚠️ Products Table (line 5585): Needs update to match exact demo format

## Required Updates

### 1. Update loadExtractedProductsTable Function
The products table needs to be updated to match the exact format from EXACT_WORKING_DEMO.html:

**Current Issues:**
- Wrong column order (has ID column at end, should have Total Units after Stack)
- Not using getConfidenceColor function
- Confidence display doesn't use badge style
- Missing proper calculation of Total Units

**Required Changes:**
- Column order: Shelf, Pos, Section, Brand, Product, Price, Facings, Stack, Total Units, Confidence, Color, Volume
- Use getConfidenceColor(confidence) for color mapping
- Display confidence as colored badge: `<span style="...background: ${confidenceColor};">`
- Show facings as `product.quantity?.columns || 1`
- Calculate total units as `product.quantity?.total_facings || 1`

### 2. Verify React Component
The InteractivePlanogram React component (used in Advanced mode) should also implement these exact rules. This component is loaded from `/static/components/InteractivePlanogram.js`.

## Key Rules Summary

1. **Cumulative Positioning**: Don't use JSON positions directly, calculate cumulative positions
2. **Global Width**: All shelves must have same width for alignment
3. **Gravity**: Products stack from bottom of shelf
4. **Facings**: Each facing gets its own grid cell (3 facings = 3 cells wide)
5. **Sections**: Hidden from users but used for AI (Left/Center/Right)
6. **Confidence Colors**: Use exact thresholds (95%, 85%, 70%)
7. **Empty Slots**: Must be completely transparent
8. **Stacking**: Vertical arrangement for depth visualization

## Next Steps

1. Update the loadExtractedProductsTable function to match exact demo
2. Verify InteractivePlanogram.js implements same rules
3. Test all modes (Queue, Simple, Advanced, Intelligence) to ensure consistency
