# Dashboard Backend Integration Complete

## Changes Implemented

### 1. **Save Buttons for Each Stage**
- Added a "Save Stage" button that appears after the Models selection
- Button changes color and text to "✓ Stage Saved" when a stage is saved
- Shows success/error messages next to the button

### 2. **Configuration Preview Box**
- Added a preview section above the "Save Configuration" button
- Shows the current system, budget, and all configured stages
- Updates automatically when stages are saved
- Only appears when at least one stage is configured

### 3. **Backend Saving Implementation**
- **Stage Save**: Saves individual stage configurations to state
- **Full Configuration Save**: 
  - Saves field definitions to `/api/field-definitions`
  - Saves prompts to `/api/prompts`
  - Saves overall config to `/api/config/save`
- **Load Configuration**: 
  - Loads active field definitions from `/api/field-definitions/active`
  - Loads active prompts from `/api/prompts/active`
  - Restores all saved configurations

### 4. **State Tracking for Saved Stages**
- Visual indicator (green checkmark) on stage tabs for saved stages
- Tracks which stages have been saved in the current session
- Maintains stage configurations when switching between tabs
- Clears saved indicators after full configuration save

### 5. **Configuration Loading**
- "Load Previous Config" button fetches saved configurations
- Automatically populates fields, prompts, and settings
- Updates the current stage view with loaded data

## Key Features

### Data Persistence

### User Experience
