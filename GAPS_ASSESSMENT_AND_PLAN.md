# Gap Assessment: Current Implementation vs Brief Requirements

## Critical Gaps Analysis

### 1. Queue Page - COMPLETELY DISCONNECTED
**Brief Requirements:**
- View and process shelf images from Supabase queue
- Show: Store, Category, Date, Status
- Select multiple items for processing
- Monitor running extractions

**Current State:**
- ❌ Mock data only - NO Supabase connection
- ❌ Missing columns: store_name, category, date, metadata
- ❌ No real queue item IDs or upload_ids
- ❌ Process button doesn't actually start extraction
- ❌ Monitor button shows fake data

**What's Needed:**
- Connect to `ai_extraction_queue` table
- Join with `uploads` table for metadata
- Use real queue item structure with all fields
- Actually trigger master orchestrator on process
- Real monitoring data from running extractions

### 2. Extraction Config - NO INSTRUCTOR INTEGRATION
**Brief Requirements:**
- Configure prompts for each stage
- Define fields to extract with Pydantic types
- Support nested objects for Instructor
- Save/load configurations
- Show prompt performance stats

**Current State:**
- ❌ Field definition is just visual - not connected to Instructor
- ❌ No nested object support
- ❌ Can't actually create Pydantic models
- ❌ Prompts not loaded from Supabase
- ❌ No real performance data

**What's Needed:**
- Build actual Pydantic model from field definitions
- Support nested structures (e.g., section.position)
- Load prompts from `meta_prompts` table
- Show real accuracy/usage stats
- Actually save field definitions to `field_definitions` table

### 3. Results Page - FAKE EVERYTHING
**Brief Requirements:**
- Show original image vs generated planogram
- Display extracted products table
- Allow corrections with feedback
- Show detailed iteration timeline
- Display what was locked/fixed each iteration

**Current State:**
- ❌ Mock products data
- ❌ Placeholder SVG instead of real planogram
- ❌ No connection to extraction results
- ❌ No real iteration data
- ❌ Corrections don't save to database

**What's Needed:**
- Load real extraction results from `ai_extraction_runs`
- Get actual planogram SVG from planogram generator
- Show real products with positions/prices
- Load iteration details from stored data
- Save corrections to `extraction_feedback` table

### 4. Analytics - COMPLETELY FAKE
**Brief Requirements:**
- System performance metrics
- Prompt performance with real usage data
- Cost analysis from actual runs
- Iteration patterns from real extractions

**Current State:**
- ❌ All hardcoded mock data
- ❌ No Supabase queries
- ❌ No aggregation of real metrics
- ❌ Charts show fake data

**What's Needed:**
- Query real metrics from Supabase
- Aggregate performance by system/prompt/stage
- Calculate actual costs from API usage
- Analyze real iteration patterns

### 5. Orchestrator Integration - NOT CONNECTED
**Brief Requirements:**
- Complete pipeline: Extract → Planogram → Compare → Iterate
- Smart iteration with selective locking
- Real visual comparison
- Monitor progress in real-time

**Current State:**
- ❌ Queue processing doesn't actually run orchestrator
- ❌ Monitoring shows fake updates
- ❌ No real visual comparison happening
- ❌ Smart iteration manager not properly integrated

**What's Needed:**
- Actually run master orchestrator when processing
- Hook monitoring updates into real extraction progress
- Implement real image vs planogram comparison
- Use smart iteration results to guide re-extraction

### 6. Live Monitoring - FAKE UPDATES
**Brief Requirements:**
- Real-time extraction progress
- Show current iteration/stage
- Display locked items
- Model status updates

**Current State:**
- ❌ Shows hardcoded timeline
- ❌ No WebSocket connection
- ❌ Fake model statuses
- ❌ No real progress tracking

**What's Needed:**
- WebSocket connection for real-time updates
- Hook into orchestrator progress events
- Show actual locked products
- Display real model processing status

## Detailed Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Fix Data Connections (Priority: CRITICAL)

```

#### 1.2 Field Definitions with Instructor
```python
# Build real Pydantic models from UI definitions

```

#### 1.3 Connect Prompts to Supabase

```

### Phase 2: Fix Extraction Pipeline (Priority: HIGH)

#### 2.1 Wire Up Real Orchestrator
```python
# Make queue processing actually work

- Pass real configuration from UI
- Store results properly
- Update queue status
```

```python
# Add WebSocket support
- Create WebSocket manager
- Hook orchestrator events
- Stream real progress updates
- Show actual model outputs
```

#### 2.3 Fix Image Comparison
```python
# Implement actual visual comparison

```

## Technical Requirements

### Database Tables Needed:
1. `ai_extraction_queue` - Already exists
2. `meta_prompts` - For prompt management
3. `field_definitions` - For extraction schemas
4. `ai_extraction_runs` - For results
5. `extraction_feedback` - For corrections
6. `iteration_details` - For iteration tracking

### API Endpoints to Fix:
1. `/api/queue/items` - Query real queue
2. `/api/queue/process/{id}` - Actually run extraction
3. `/api/prompts/available` - Load from database
4. `/api/results/{id}` - Get real results
5. `/api/analytics/*` - Query real metrics

### WebSocket Events Needed:
1. `extraction_started`
2. `iteration_progress`
3. `stage_complete`
4. `model_update`
5. `extraction_complete`

## Priority Order for Implementation:

1. **Fix Queue Connection** - Without this, nothing works
2. **Wire Up Orchestrator** - Make extraction actually happen
3. **Implement Monitoring** - See what's happening
4. **Fix Results Display** - Show real outputs
5. **Connect Analytics** - Track performance

## Time Estimate:
- Phase 1: 2-3 days (Critical foundation)
- Phase 2: 3-4 days (Core functionality)
- Phase 3: 2-3 days (User interaction)
- Phase 4: 1-2 days (Analytics)

Total: 8-12 days for complete implementation

## Next Immediate Steps:
1. Fix queue API to query real Supabase data
2. Make process button actually call orchestrator
3. Implement WebSocket for real monitoring
4. Connect results to real extraction data
5. Test end-to-end flow with real image
