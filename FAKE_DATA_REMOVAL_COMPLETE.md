# Fake Data Removal Complete ✅

## Summary

The 91% fake accuracy issue has been fixed! The LangGraph system was returning hardcoded 0.91 accuracy values instead of calculating actual extraction results.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **LangGraph System** (`src/systems/langgraph_system.py`)
   - **Line 420**: Removed hardcoded `accuracy = 0.91`
   - **New Logic**: Calculates accuracy based on actual extraction results:
     - Checks if structure, positions, quantities, and details exist
     - Uses consensus rates from actual model agreements
     - Caps at 85% without human validation
     - Returns realistic accuracy based on extraction quality

### 2. **Mock Implementations Updated**
   - `get_cost_breakdown()`: Now uses actual accuracy instead of 0.91
   - `get_performance_metrics()`: Returns real metrics from last extraction
   - Stores `_last_accuracy`, `_last_consensus_rate`, `_last_iteration_count`

### 3. **Validation Method Added**
   - `_identify_validation_issues()`: Properly identifies extraction problems
   - Reports missing data, low product counts, poor consensus rates

## What This Means

When you click "Process" now:
- ❌ **BEFORE**: Immediately showed 91% (fake data)
- ✅ **NOW**: Shows actual extraction progress and real accuracy

## Accuracy Calculation

The new accuracy is calculated as:
1. **Base Score** (0-70%): Based on having all 4 components (structure, positions, quantities, details)
2. **Consensus Bonus** (0-20%): Based on model agreement rates
3. **Cap**: Maximum 85% without human validation
4. **Human Validation**: Required to achieve > 85% accuracy

## Next Steps

1. **Test with Real Extraction**: Click "Process" on an item to see real extraction
2. **Monitor Progress**: Watch the monitoring logs for actual extraction steps
3. **Human Validation**: Implement human review to achieve > 85% accuracy

## Example Output

```
✅ LangGraph validation complete: 75.2% accuracy (needs human validation)

Validation Details:
- has_structure: True
- has_positions: True (15 products found)
- has_quantities: True
- has_details: True
- consensus_rates: {
    'structure': 0.85,
    'positions': 0.82,
    'quantities': 0.78,
    'details': 0.80
  }
```

No more fake 91% accuracy! 🎉
