## Technical Architecture Improvements

### Frontend Enhancements
```javascript
// Enhanced extraction configuration state
let extractionConfig = {
    system: 'custom_consensus',
    models: { structure: 'claude', products: 'gpt4o', details: 'gemini' },
    prompts: { structure: 'auto', products: 'auto', details: 'auto' },
    autoSelectReasoning: {}
};

// Performance data caching
let promptPerformanceCache = {};

// Context-aware recommendations
async function loadSmartRecommendations() {
    const context = extractContextFromSelectedItems();
    const recommendations = await fetchRecommendations(context);
    displayRecommendationsWithReasoning(recommendations);
}
```

### Backend Integration
```python
# Enhanced batch configuration endpoint
@router.post("/batch-configure-enhanced")
async def batch_configure_enhanced(request: Dict[str, Any]):
    # Store full configuration with reasoning
    extraction_config = request.get('extraction_config', {})
    # Update queue items with enhanced tracking
```

### CSS Styling System
