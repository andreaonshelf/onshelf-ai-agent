# Implementation Evaluation: Current vs Agreed Changes

## 1. Pixel Coordinates Removal ✅ COMPLETED

**Agreed Change**: Remove pixel coordinates from extraction models
**Current Status**: 
- ✅ Removed `PixelCoordinates` class from extraction models
- ✅ Using relative positioning (shelf_level, position_on_shelf)
- ✅ All extraction now uses shelf-based positioning

## 2. Shelf-by-Shelf Extraction ✅ COMPLETED

**Agreed Change**: Process one shelf at a time instead of entire image
**Current Status**:
- ✅ Implemented `_execute_shelf_by_shelf_extraction()` method
- ✅ Each shelf gets its own AI prompt
- ✅ Prompts specifically say "ONLY extract from shelf X"
- ✅ Results combined after all shelves processed

## 3. Iteration Tracking Dashboard ✅ COMPLETED

**Agreed Change**: View raw JSON and planograms for each iteration
**Current Status**:
- ✅ Added "Iterations" tab in Advanced mode
- ✅ Shows raw JSON extraction data
- ✅ Shows planogram visualization per iteration
- ✅ Shows shelf-by-shelf breakdown table
- ✅ Iteration data stored via API

## 4. Automatic Planogram Generation ✅ WORKING

**Agreed Change**: Planograms should auto-generate from JSON data
**Current Status**:
- ✅ System automatically generates planograms from extraction data
- ✅ Flow: Extraction → Abstraction → Planogram → SVG
- ✅ No manual planogram creation needed
- ❌ Mock data example was manually created (my error in demo)

## 5. AI Model Fallback ✅ COMPLETED

**Agreed Change**: Fallback when models reject images
**Current Status**:
- ✅ Implemented fallback chain: Claude → GPT-4 → Gemini
- ✅ Handles content moderation rejections
- ✅ Automatic retry with next model

## 6. Image Compression ✅ COMPLETED

**Agreed Change**: Compress images for AI model limits
**Current Status**:
- ✅ Compression for Claude's 5MB limit
- ✅ Applied in both extraction engine and structure agent
- ✅ Maintains quality while reducing size

## 7. Real Extraction (No Mock Data) ✅ COMPLETED

**Agreed Change**: Remove all mock data, use real AI extraction
**Current Status**:
- ✅ Mock extraction methods removed
- ✅ Real AI models called for extraction
- ✅ Only mock data is for dashboard demo purposes

## Issues Identified:

1. **Performance**: Shelf-by-shelf extraction is slower (5 API calls vs 1)
   - Trade-off: Better accuracy vs speed
   - Possible optimization: Process 2-3 shelves in parallel

2. **Model Consistency**: Different models may extract different facings
   - This is expected AI behavior
   - Cumulative learning helps stabilize results

3. **Dashboard Mock Data**: My demo planogram was manual, not auto-generated
   - This was just for demonstration
   - Real system uses automatic generation

## Recommendations:

1. **Add Progress Indicators**: Show which shelf is being processed
2. **Parallel Processing**: Process multiple shelves concurrently 
3. **Caching**: Cache structure analysis between iterations
4. **Confidence Thresholds**: Adjustable thresholds for when to retry
