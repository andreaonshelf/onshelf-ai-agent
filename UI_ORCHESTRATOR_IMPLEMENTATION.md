# OnShelf UI and Orchestrator Implementation Summary

## Overview
We have successfully implemented a completely revamped UI and clarified the role of the orchestrator to manage the COMPLETE pipeline flow: Image → Extract to JSON → Generate Planogram → Compare to Original → Smart Iteration.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. New Unified Dashboard (new_dashboard.html)
- **Navigation Structure**: OnShelf Logo | Queue | Extraction Config | Results | Analytics
- **React-based SPA** with modern UI components
- **Real-time updates** using monitoring hooks

### 2. Queue Page
- View and process shelf images from Supabase queue
- Select multiple items for batch processing
- Shows current configuration (system type and budget)
- Live status updates (Ready, Processing, Complete)
- Monitor button for running extractions

### 3. Extraction Config Page
- **System Selection**: Custom Consensus, LangGraph, or Hybrid
- **Budget Control**: Max spend per image
- **Stage Configuration**: 
  - Structure Analysis
  - Product Extraction
  - Detail Enhancement
  - Validation
- **Prompt Management**: Select from library or create new
- **Field Definition**: Define extraction schema with Pydantic-compatible types

### 4. Results Page
- Side-by-side view: Original Image vs Generated Planogram
- Accuracy metrics and cost breakdown
- Extracted products table with correction capability
- Expandable extraction details showing:
  - Iteration timeline
  - What was locked from previous iterations
  - What each iteration fixed
  - Model outputs and consensus decisions

### 5. Analytics Dashboard
- System Performance comparison
- Stage Performance metrics
- Cost per Accuracy analysis
- Prompt Performance tracking
- Smart Iteration Patterns
- Model Efficiency by stage

### 6. Live Monitoring Modal
- Real-time extraction progress
- Current iteration and stage
- Locked items from previous iterations
- Model status (Claude, GPT-4, Gemini)
- Force continue/abort options for stuck extractions

## Orchestrator Enhancements

### 1. Master Orchestrator (master_orchestrator.py)
- Manages the COMPLETE pipeline flow
- Integrates monitoring hooks for real-time updates
- Uses smart iteration manager for selective locking

### 2. Smart Iteration Manager (smart_iteration_manager.py)
- **Selective Locking**: Locks high-confidence positions
- **Targeted Re-extraction**: Only re-processes failing areas
- **Issue Tracking**: Identifies specific problems (missing products, wrong positions, price errors)
- **Efficiency Metrics**: Tracks locked vs reprocessed positions

### 3. Monitoring Hooks (monitoring_hooks.py)
- Provides real-time updates to the UI
- Tracks stage progression
- Updates model status
- Records locked items and focus areas

### 4. Queue Processing API (queue_processing.py)
- Handles extraction requests from UI
- Background task processing
- Real-time monitoring endpoints
- Force complete/abort functionality

## Key Principles Implemented

1. **Optimize for final visual accuracy**, not JSON correctness
2. **Build cumulatively** - don't throw away correct work
3. **Visual comparison drives decisions** - know exactly what's wrong
4. **Surgical fixes** - only re-process what failed
5. **Budget aware** - stop when good enough within cost constraints

## API Endpoints Added

### Queue Processing
- `POST /api/queue/process/{item_id}` - Start processing
- `GET /api/queue/monitor/{item_id}` - Get monitoring data
- `POST /api/queue/force-complete/{item_id}` - Force completion
- `POST /api/queue/abort/{item_id}` - Abort processing
- `GET /api/queue/results/{item_id}` - Get results

### Analytics
- `GET /api/analytics/system-performance` - System metrics
- `GET /api/analytics/prompt-performance` - Prompt metrics
- `GET /api/analytics/stage-performance` - Stage metrics
- `GET /api/analytics/cost-analysis` - Cost vs accuracy
- `GET /api/analytics/iteration-patterns` - Common patterns
- `GET /api/analytics/model-efficiency` - Model performance

### Configuration
- `GET /api/queue/config/save` - Save configuration
- `GET /api/prompts/available` - Get available prompts

## Smart Iteration Example

**Iteration 1:**
- Extract everything (structure + all products)
- Generate planogram
- Compare: "68% accurate - missing products on shelf 2, wrong structure for shelf 4"
- Lock: Nothing yet

**Iteration 2:**
- Re-extract structure (was wrong)
- Re-extract all products with better prompts
- Generate planogram
- Compare: "84% accurate - structure correct now, still missing shelf 2 products"
- Lock: Structure (4 shelves), Products on shelves 1,3,4

**Iteration 3:**
- Keep locked: Structure, most products
- Re-extract ONLY shelf 2 products
- Generate planogram
- Compare: "92% accurate - just price errors remaining"
- Done (within budget)

## What Makes This Smart

Instead of blind retries, the orchestrator:
- **SEES** what's wrong (via planogram comparison)
- **PRESERVES** what's right (via locking)
- **TARGETS** specific fixes (re-run only failing parts)
- **MANAGES** costs (selective re-processing)

This approach typically uses 10-12 API calls instead of 21+ for blind retries.

## Running the System

1. Start the server: `python main.py`
2. Navigate to: `http://localhost:8000`
3. The new dashboard will load automatically

## Next Steps

1. Connect to real planogram generation
2. Implement actual visual comparison (currently mocked)
3. Add WebSocket support for real-time updates
4. Integrate with existing human feedback system
5. Add export functionality for results
