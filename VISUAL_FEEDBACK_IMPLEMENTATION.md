# Visual Feedback Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

### 1. System Routing Fixed ✅
- Master Orchestrator now routes to the actual 3 systems (Custom/LangGraph/Hybrid)
- Previously always created `ExtractionOrchestrator` regardless of selection
- Now uses `ExtractionSystemFactory` to instantiate the correct system

### 2. Structure Analysis Agent Removed ✅
- Deleted `src/agents/structure_agent.py` 
- Updated extraction orchestrator to use `_execute_structure_stage` with UI prompts
- Structure stage now configurable like Products/Details stages

### 3. Visual Feedback Loop Implemented ✅
- Created `CustomConsensusVisualSystem` that implements the flow:
  - Model 1 extracts → Generate planogram → Visual compare → Feedback
  - Model 2 gets feedback → Extract → Generate planogram → Compare → Feedback
  - Model 3 gets accumulated feedback → Extract → Final result
- Visual feedback is informational - models can disagree with previous assessments

### 4. UI Configuration for Comparison Prompts ✅
- Added 'comparison' stage to UI with appropriate fields
- Comparison prompts can be configured and saved like other stages
- Image Comparison Agent updated to accept custom prompts
- Master Orchestrator passes comparison prompts from configuration

## How the Visual Feedback Flow Works

### Stage-Based Processing with Multiple Models
```python
For each stage (structure, products, details):
    For each model in stage:
        1. Build prompt with visual feedback from previous models
        2. Extract with current model
        3. Generate planogram (except structure stage)
        4. Visual comparison with original image
        5. Extract actionable feedback
        6. Pass feedback to next model
    Apply consensus voting on all model results
```

### Visual Feedback in Prompts
```
VISUAL FEEDBACK FROM PREVIOUS MODELS:
Model 1 (claude-3-sonnet):
- Missing product at shelf 2, position 4
- Quantity issue for Coca-Cola: Shows 2 but image suggests 3

Model 2 (gpt-4o):
- Successfully identified product at shelf 2, position 4 as "Sprite Zero"
- Coca-Cola facing count now correct (3)

Consider this visual feedback in your extraction, but make your own independent assessment.
```

### Consensus Voting with Visual Weights
- Models with fewer visual issues get higher voting weight
- 0 issues: 1.2x weight (bonus)
- 1-2 issues: 1.0x weight (normal)
- 3-5 issues: 0.8x weight (slight penalty)
- 6+ issues: 0.6x weight (significant penalty)

## Key Architecture Changes

### Before:
- System selection ignored
- Hardcoded Structure Agent
- Planogram generated after all extraction
- No visual feedback between models
- Comparison prompt hardcoded

### After:
- Three systems actually used based on UI selection
- Structure stage uses configurable prompts
- Planogram generated after each model
- Visual feedback flows between models
- Comparison prompts configurable in UI

## What Still Needs Implementation

### 1. LangGraph System with Visual Feedback
- Implement state machine nodes for visual comparison
- Add feedback edges in the graph
- Handle model disagreements via state transitions

### 2. Hybrid System with Visual Feedback  
- Combine LangChain memory with visual feedback
- Use semantic similarity for visual feedback clustering
- Enhanced reasoning with both data and visual context

### 3. Real Integration Points
- Connect actual planogram generation (currently placeholder)
- Connect actual image comparison (currently placeholder)
- Wire up real extraction engine calls

### 4. Backend Configuration Storage
- Ensure comparison prompts are properly stored
- Add stage_prompts to extraction configuration
- Verify all stages flow through to extraction

## Testing the Implementation

1. **System Selection**: Choose different systems in UI and verify different behavior
2. **Visual Feedback**: Check that Model 2/3 receive feedback in their prompts
3. **Model Disagreement**: Verify models can disagree with previous assessments
4. **Comparison Prompts**: Save custom comparison prompts and verify they're used
5. **Consensus Voting**: Check that visual issues affect voting weights

## Next Steps

1. Complete LangGraph and Hybrid system implementations
2. Wire up real planogram generation and comparison
3. Add monitoring for visual feedback effectiveness
4. Create metrics for how often models accept/reject visual feedback
5. Optimize prompt engineering for visual feedback inclusion
