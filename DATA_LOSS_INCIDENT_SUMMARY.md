# Data Loss Incident Report - Queue Item 9

## Executive Summary
Real production extraction data for Co-op Food - Greenwich was overwritten with test data, causing loss of valuable extraction results. This incident exposed critical security vulnerabilities in our data management practices.

## Timeline of Events

### June 8, 2025 (Day 1)
- **22:18:55** - Extraction started for Co-op Food - Greenwich - Trafalgar Road
- **23:03:02** - Extraction completed successfully
  - Cost: $0.12 in API calls
  - Accuracy: 91%
  - Real Co-op products extracted from shelf image

### June 9, 2025 (Day 2) 
- **~00:00:00** - Developer created `add_test_extraction_data.py` for debugging
- **~01:08:00** - Script executed, overwriting real data with test products:
  - Coca Cola Classic
  - Pepsi Regular
  - Sprite Lemon-Lime
  - Mountain Dew

## Root Causes

1. **No Environment Separation**
   - Same database used for development and production
   - No protection against modifying production data

2. **Unrestricted Database Access**
   - Direct write access via service keys
   - No row-level security policies
   - No audit trail

3. **Poor Code Organization**
   - Test scripts mixed with production code
   - No clear separation between dev/test/prod utilities

4. **No Data Protection**
   - No backups before updates
   - No validation against test data patterns
   - No approval process for data modifications

## Impact

- **Data Lost**: Real Co-op product extraction results
- **Cost**: $0.12 API cost + 45 minutes processing time
- **Trust**: Production data integrity compromised
- **Risk**: Could happen again without preventive measures

## Actions Taken

### Immediate (Completed)
1. **Quarantined 18 Dangerous Scripts**
   - `add_test_extraction_data.py` (the culprit)
   - `HARD_RESET_ALL_DATA.py`
   - `clear_all_fake_data.py`
   - And 15 others that can modify production data

2. **Created Data Protection System**
   - `src/database/protection.py` - Validates data before updates
   - Detects test data patterns
   - Requires environment checks
   - Creates audit trail

3. **Prepared Audit Infrastructure**
   - `create_audit_tables.sql` - Comprehensive audit logging
   - Automatic backups before updates
   - Dangerous change detection
   - Restore capabilities

4. **Documentation**
   - `SAFETY_GUIDELINES.md` - Best practices
   - `SECURITY_REPORT_TEST_DATA_INSERTION.md` - Detailed analysis
   - This incident report

### Required (Not Yet Implemented)

1. **Deploy Audit Tables**
   ```bash
   psql $DATABASE_URL < create_audit_tables.sql
   ```

2. **Separate Environments**
   - Create development database
   - Restrict production access
   - Use read-only credentials for analysis

3. **Update All Scripts**
   - Use DataProtection class
   - Add environment checks
   - Require confirmations

4. **Recover Lost Data**
   - Re-process queue item 9
   - Original image still available (upload_id: upload-1748342011996-y1y6yk)

## Prevention Plan

### Technical Controls
1. **Environment Separation**
   - Separate databases for dev/staging/prod
   - Environment-specific credentials
   - Automated environment detection

2. **Access Control**
   - Production writes only through API
   - Service accounts with minimal permissions
   - Regular permission audits

3. **Data Validation**
   - Test data pattern detection
   - Backup before modifications
   - Rollback capabilities

4. **Monitoring**
   - Alert on production data changes
   - Track unusual patterns
   - Regular integrity checks

### Process Controls
1. **Code Organization**
   ```
   project/
   ├── src/              # Production code only
   ├── scripts/
   │   ├── production/   # Requires approval
   │   └── development/  # Cannot run in prod
   └── tests/            # Test fixtures only
   ```

2. **Approval Process**
   - Production changes require review
   - Automated checks for dangerous patterns
   - Audit trail of who approved what

3. **Testing Strategy**
   - Use proper test fixtures
   - Never modify real data for testing
   - Mark all test data clearly

## Lessons Learned

1. **Convenience vs Security**: Easy database access led to accidental data loss
2. **Mixed Environments**: Development and production must be separated
3. **Audit Trail**: Every data modification should be tracked
4. **Backup First**: Always backup before any update
5. **Test Data**: Should never exist in production systems

## Conclusion

This incident was preventable and highlights the need for proper data governance. The immediate quarantine of dangerous scripts and creation of protection systems addresses the symptoms, but full implementation of environment separation and access controls is required to prevent recurrence.

**Status**: PARTIALLY RESOLVED  
**Risk Level**: HIGH until all preventive measures implemented  
**Data Recovery**: POSSIBLE via re-extraction
