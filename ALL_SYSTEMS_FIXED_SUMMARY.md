# All Extraction Systems Fixed - Summary

## Status: ALL THREE SYSTEMS NOW USE REAL EXTRACTION ✅

### 1. Custom Consensus Visual System ✅
- **Status**: Already working with real extraction
- Uses `ModularExtractionEngine` for actual AI calls
- Implements visual feedback loop
- Processes real images with user's configured prompts and fields

### 2. LangGraph System ✅ 
- **Status**: FULLY FIXED
- **What Was Fixed**:
  - `_run_structure_agents`: Now uses real extraction with dynamic models
  - Position consensus: Uses real product extraction
  - Quantity/Detail nodes: Extract from actual product data
  - All mock data removed
- **Key Changes**:
  - Added extraction engine initialization
  - Uses `self.extraction_engine.execute_with_model_id()` for all stages
  - Builds dynamic models from user configuration
  - Properly parses extraction results

### 3. Hybrid System ✅
- **Status**: FULLY FIXED  
- **What Was Fixed**:
  - `_get_structure_proposals`: Real extraction with multiple models
  - `_get_position_proposals`: Real product extraction per shelf
  - `_hybrid_quantity_consensus`: Uses product data or focused extraction
  - `_hybrid_detail_consensus`: Real detail extraction with OCR
  - `_hybrid_end_to_end_validation`: Calculates real accuracy metrics
  - `_enhanced_consensus_reasoning`: Analyzes real proposal data
- **Key Changes**:
  - All mock data replaced with real extraction calls
  - Integrated extraction engine throughout
  - Proper cost tracking for all API calls
  - Real consensus calculations based on extraction results

## Key Pattern Used for All Systems

```python
# 1. Get configuration
prompt = getattr(self, 'stage_prompts', {}).get(stage, default_prompt)
output_schema = self._get_output_schema_for_stage(stage)

# 2. Real extraction
result, cost = await self.extraction_engine.execute_with_model_id(
    model_id=model,
    prompt=prompt,
    images={'enhanced': image_data},
    output_schema=output_schema,
    agent_id=f"{system}_{stage}_{model}"
)

# 3. Parse results based on stage
shelf_count = self._extract_shelf_count_from_result(result)
products = self._extract_products_from_result(result)
# etc.
```

## What This Means

Now when you process items:
1. **All three systems** will make real API calls to AI models
2. Processing will take 30-60 seconds (not instant)
3. You'll see real product names from the images
4. Costs will accumulate from actual API usage
5. Results will vary based on image quality and model performance
6. Your configured prompts and fields will be used

## Testing the Fix

To verify all systems work:
1. Process an item with each system
2. Check the logs for "execute_with_model_id" calls
3. Verify processing takes time (not instant)
4. Check that results contain real product names
5. Monitor API costs accumulating

## Key Files Changed

1. `/src/systems/langgraph_system.py`
   - Replaced all mock methods with real extraction
   - Added helper methods for parsing results

2. `/src/systems/hybrid_system.py`
   - Replaced all mock consensus methods
   - Added real extraction throughout
   - Fixed validation to use actual metrics

Both systems now follow the same pattern as the working custom_consensus_visual system.
