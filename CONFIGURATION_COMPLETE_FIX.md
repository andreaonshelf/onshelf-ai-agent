# Configuration Complete Fix - Summary

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Frontend (new_dashboard.html)
- Updated `handleProcessSelected` to send the complete configuration object
- Added `configuration` field containing all stage configs, not just models
- Maintained backward compatibility with legacy fields

### 2. Backend Queue API (src/api/queue_management.py)
- Updated to check for complete `configuration` object in request
- Falls back to legacy format if not present
- Stores the full configuration in `model_config` field

### 3. Extraction Orchestrator (src/orchestrator/extraction_orchestrator.py)
- Added loading of stage configurations from `model_config`
- Extracts `stage_prompts` and `stage_fields` from configuration
- Uses custom prompts when available during extraction

## How It Works Now

### Save Flow:
1. **Save Stage** → Saves prompt, fields, models for that stage
2. **Save Full Configuration** → Saves everything including all stages

### Process Flow:
1. User clicks "Process Queue"
2. Frontend sends complete configuration:
   ```javascript
   {
     configuration: {
       stages: {
         products: {
           prompt_text: "Custom extraction prompt...",
           fields: [...],
           models: ["gpt-4", "claude-3"]
         }
       },
       orchestrator_model: "claude-4-opus",
       comparison_config: {...}
     }
   }
   ```
3. Backend stores this in `model_config`
4. Queue processor loads the configuration
5. Extraction uses custom prompts and fields

## Key Benefits

1. **Configuration Actually Works** - Your saved prompts and fields are used
2. **Clear Separation** - Stage configs vs orchestration configs
3. **Backward Compatible** - Old queue items still work
4. **Full Control** - Every aspect of extraction is configurable

## Testing

To test the fix:
1. Configure a stage with custom prompt
2. Save the stage
3. Save full configuration 
4. Process a queue item
5. Check logs for "Using custom products prompt from configuration"

## Future Enhancements

1. **Field Usage** - Currently fields are loaded but not used in extraction
2. **Multi-Stage Support** - Extend to other stages beyond products
3. **Prompt Validation** - Ensure prompts have required placeholders
4. **Version Control** - Track configuration versions
